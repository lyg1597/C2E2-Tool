1) Bruss.mdl

Model file for the brussellator dynamical system. Typical initial configuration
of the system is

x>=2.0&&x<=3.0&&y>=1.0&&y<=1.5


2) cardiacCell.mdl

Simplified model for the heart cell. The initial configuration is from mode stimOn.

t>=0&&t<=0&&u>=0&&u<=0&&v>=0&&v<=0

The unsafe condition is when the electric potential increases the value of 2.5

i.e. u>=2.5

3) FourGridNavigation2.mdl

Models the behavior of a particle in 2-dimensional space. The region is divided into
4 grids and the velocities in each of the grids is specified as linear differential
equations. Typical initial condition is starting from the mode Zone1

x>=0.45&&x<=0.5&&y>=0.45&&y<=0.5&&vx>=0&&vx<=0&&vy>=0&&vy<=0

Unsafe condition is when the y coordinate of the particle is more than 3.

y>=3.0

4) LinThermo.mdl

Models the temperature variation in the room, as linear ODE. The thermostat turns on 
the cooling when temperature increases the threshold of 75 degrees. It is turned off
when temperature hits 65 degrees. Typical initial condition would be that in the 
mode heating with temperature in the range [68-72]. Unsafe condition would be when
temperature reaches 80 degrees

5) MG.mdl

A model of the Jet-Engine given as a nonlinear ODE.

6) VanDerPol.mdl

Nonlinear ODE model of the Vanderpol oscillator system. It exhibits contracting behavior in a subset of the state space where x>=0. Typical initial states would be 
x>=3.0&&x<=4.0&&y>=1.0&&y<=2.0
