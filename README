C2E2 is a tool for veryfying bounded time invariant properties of Stateflow models. 

This software is provided as is for academic research usage. We are maiking this preliminary version available for you to try out the key features of C2E2 and to get your feedback. In the coming weeks we will share newer versions with many more examples and a more complete user guide. If you find this tool to be useful please send a message to the email address given below, and we will send you the latest version with an academic/research license.


Installation: 

1. Install required packages: run ./installRequirements script. 
Please run it in sudo (Admin), so that the dependencies can be installed in the system.

2. Compile C2E2: run ./installC2E2

3. Invoke C2E2: run ./runC2E2. 
A GUI should appear with the options to load models. 

Examples: 

C2E2 uses as input stateflow models which have to be created using Mathwork's Matlab/Simulink environment. Several such models are given in /Examples/ directory. The examples are Simulink Stateflow models with "annotations" needed by the verification algorithm. Upon loading the models in the system, you can run the verification. After the verification, C2E2 plots the set of all reachable states. Enjoy!


Some known issues:

C2E2 has been tested on Ubuntu Linux (both 11.10 and 12.04) with the given packages installed. If some of the packages are missing then C2E2 may silently fail.
