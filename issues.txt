GENERAL
Don't understand the point of creating/compiling *.cpp files and generating all the separate output files that are used for simulating the system. It process could be significantly simplied without this extraneous stuff. 

It may be better to have a C++ frontend that will be able to interact with the backend much easier because using Python requires all this baggage.

Shouldn't it be possible to check the guards/invariants on the fly without having to run it over the output file later.
