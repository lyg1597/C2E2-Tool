Simulator
*********
c2e2.py creates all the C++ files on lines 193 - 199
The files are then compiled and moved in verifyAbortBtnCallback (ln 1013 - 1035).
./C2E2 to called in verifyAbortBtnCallback (ln 1278)
In the main.cpp (ln 152), a Simulator is created and simulates the system (ln 293).
A ReachTube class parses the simulated output, bloats the tubes and generates reachtube.dat (ln 310, 350)
The system is then checked using ./invariants and ./guards (ln 359 - 360)

The following functions are in hyir.py:

printInvariants - reads from the reachtube.dat file and writes into the invariant.dat file. For each line read from the reachtube, the code checks whether the invariant was satisfied by the reachtube.

printGuardsResets - 

hyirXML (ln 1492) - generates the hybrid representation which is used later tused for conversion to CAPD

convertToCAPD (ln 702) - generates the simulator.cpp code
